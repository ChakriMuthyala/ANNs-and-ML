2. Logistic Regression

3. Linear and Multivariate Polynomial Regression

4. Reinforcement Learning Solutions for the book:
   Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto


## Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression applied mainly from Andrew Ng's CS229 lecture notes and online tutorials. Applied on IRIS data for 2 features

## Multivariate Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression
This is a sample data set provided by HackerRank for the prediction of Office Prices based on 2 or more features. I have applied Multivariate Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression on this set using Normal Equation of Least Squares method in Matrix form.
